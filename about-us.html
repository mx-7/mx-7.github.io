    <p class="mb-4">
        We are a group of students from King Saud University (KSU) working on
        this project to deliver a luxurious and user-friendly restaurant
        experience. Our mission is to provide a seamless and enjoyable
        experience for all our patrons.

    <p class="mb-4">
        As students, this project has been a learning journey, allowing us to
        apply our academic knowledge to a real-world scenario. We have
        incorporated the latest technologies and best practices to create a
        platform that is not only functional but also visually appealing and
        easy to use.
