        We are a group of students from King Saud University (KSU) working on
        this project to deliver a luxurious and user-friendly hotel booking
        experience. Our mission is to provide a seamless and enjoyable
        experience for all our users.

        platform that is not only functional but also visually appealing and
        easy to use.
